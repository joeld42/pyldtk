# pyldtk
Python wrappers for LDTK tile level format

Loads tilemap levels created by [LTDK](https://ldtk.io/)

File format details: https://ldtk.io/json/

I'm using this for a converter to [Luxe Engine](https://luxeengine.com/) tilemaps,
I will include that converter once Luxe is in public preview, contact me
on the Luxe discord if you are in the private beta and want to use it.
