Python wrappers for LDTK tile level format

Loads tilemap levels created by [LTDK](https://ldtk.io/)

File format details: https://ldtk.io/json/

There is also an auto-generated loader available at [LDTK api page](https://ldtk.io/api/). That one might be more complete, this is a hand-coded loader that I find easier to use. 

## Luxe Converter

I'm using this for a converter from LDTK to [Luxe Engine](https://luxeengine.com/) tilemaps,
I will include that converter once Luxe is in public preview, contact me
on the Luxe discord if you are in the private beta and want to use it.
